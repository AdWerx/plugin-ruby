## [Unreleased]
### Added
- Handle `methref` nodes from Ruby `2.7`.
- Allow `module` nodes to shorten using `;` when the block is empty.

### Changed
- Handle splat within an array, as in `[1, 2, *foo]`.
- Disallow comments from being attached to intermediary regex nodes.
- Fix `to_proc` transforms to reference the method called as opposed to the parameter name.
- [INTERNAL] Change statement lists to be generated within the parser instead of the printer, thereby allowing finer control over comments.
- [INTERNAL] Completely revamp comment parsing by switching off the internal lexer state from `ripper`. This should drastically increase accuracy of comment parsing in general, and set us up for success in the future.
